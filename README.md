# First website I've ever built with my own domain.
Will keep it as a portfolio for any major projects I have to showcase. For now, I am focused on one long-term project, Poke Draft Duel.

# What will Poke Draft Duel be?
To help hone and showcase my backend development skills, I will try to make a pokemon battle simulator thats doesnt require large preparation times building a team. You simply will be given a choice of 2 randomly generated pokemon, where you pick one for yourself, and give the other to the opponent, which can either be a person or a bot. Each pokemon will randomly be given 2 damaging moves and 2 status moves from its movepool, along with a random ability that it's able to recieve. So all the preparation is just presing a few buttons.
